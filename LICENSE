Additional Terms:

1. Warning: This software may reveal the true nature of your Windows system. If your system experiences a meltdown, crashes,
or enters an existential crisis because of its overwhelming incompetence, don’t blame us—it’s Windows doing what Windows does best: failing.
   
2. Modification Rights: You are free to modify this script. Just remember, while you can make changes to fix what Microsoft never will,
you still can’t fix Windows’ deeply-rooted issues. Sorry, that’s beyond our help.

3. No Support for Edge: If you think Edge is a browser, please immediately reconsider your life choices. This script will optimize your internet,
but unfortunately, we can't force Microsoft to get rid of Edge (yet).

4. Full Responsibility: By using this script, you acknowledge that Windows will eventually break itself again no matter what you do.
But hey, you tried, and at least this script worked once.
